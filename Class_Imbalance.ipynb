Consider the extent to which it demonstrates recall of basic information (passive), application of learned knowledge to slightly different contexts (active), or a deeper level of analysis and synthesis of various concepts (constructive).\n",
            "Step 4: Critically evaluate whether the response could potentially belong to other engagement categories. Examine the nuances of the response to see if there are elements that might indicate a higher or lower level of cognitive engagement.\n",
            "Step 5: To upgrade the response to a higher engagement level, propose alterations that would make it align with the criteria for the \"Active\" category. This could involve adding details that show the application of earned knowledge to familiar yet slightly different contexts, or demonstrating problem-solving based on previous experiences.\n",
            "Step 6: Explore how the response can be restructured to meet the criteria of the \"Constructive\" engagement category. Consider adding elements that showcase deeper analysis, critical evaluation, or synthesis of multiple concepts to create a more nuanced and thoughtful response.\n",
            "Step 7: Finally, revisit the question and answer text to evaluate the original cognitive engagement level making sure the prediction of cognitive engagement is accurate.\n",
            "For example: after reading the question and answer in Step 1 the Initial Classification for step 2 is Passive engagement. The statement is quite basic, focusing on a straightforward method of determining a review’s tone, without delving into the specifics of how this can be achieved.\n",
            "For step 3: The response showcases a passive engagement because it states a simple ability to discern whether a person liked something or not, but it does not illustrate how this can be done or apply any deeperunderstanding or strategy to the process. It merely expresses a basic recall of the capability to differentiate between positive and negative reviews without further explanation or analysis.\n",
            "After critically evaluating the unlabeled text the response is fundamentally passive, it has the potential to be expanded into active or constructive categories with further detail and demonstration of analytical or critical thinking.\n",
            "To upgrade it to a higher level of engagement like Active or Constructive the response would need to be revised as follows:\n",
            "Active: To figure out if someone liked or didn't like something from a review, I'd basically check out the words they use. Like, if there are lots of good words and compliments, they probably liked it. But if there's loads of bad words or they're complaining about stuff, then they don't like it.\n",
            "Constructive: So like, one way to figure it out is to not just look at the words they use but like, the whole story they're telling in the review. Like, good reviews usually tell a happy story, leading up to all the awesome stuff. But bad reviews, they kinda like to list all the bad things one by one. Oh, tone plays an important role so it is important to pay attention to it because sometimes people use good words but they're being sarcastic and stuff, which means it's actually a bad review. So yeah, you gotta really get into itand understand the whole thing to know what they're really saying.\n",
            "Finally, when revisiting in step 7 it is apparent that it maintains a \"Passive\" cognitive engagement level as it just mentions a basic understanding without further analysis or showcasing any strategic approach to determining a review's positivity or negativity. The revised responses, on the other hand, showcase a deeper engagement with the question, representing \"Active\" and \"Constructive\" levels of cognitive engagement respectively, by progressively incorporating a more detailed analysis and critical evaluation of the different ways to analyze reviews.\n",
